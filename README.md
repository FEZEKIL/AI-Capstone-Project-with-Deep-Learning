# Capstone Project Overview
# Welcome to the AI Capstone Project with Deep Learning. In this advanced course, you will apply deep learning techniques to solve a real-world geospatial image classification problem. Using Keras and PyTorch, you will develop, train, and evaluate convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and vision transformers, gaining hands-on experience in model optimization, performance analysis, and technical reporting.

Prerequisites

Before starting this capstone project, learners should have completed the following courses from the 
IBM AI Engineering Professional Certificate (PC)
 or the 
IBM Deep Learning with PyTorch, Keras and Tensorflow PC
. These courses build the foundational skills necessary for working with deep learning frameworks, designing neural network architectures, and evaluating model performanceâ€”essential for tackling the real-world challenges in this capstone:

Machine Learning with Python

Introduction to Deep Learning & Neural Networks with Keras

Deep Learning with Keras and Tensorflow

Introduction to Neural Networks and PyTorch

Deep Learning with PyTorch

Completing these courses will equip you with the necessary skills in CNNs, transfer learning, model evaluation metrics, and deep learning frameworks, critical for success in this capstone project.

Course objectives

After completing this capstone course, you will have:

Hands-on experience building deep learning models using Keras and PyTorch to solve real-world image classification problems

Expertise in designing and implementing a complete deep learning pipeline, including data loading, augmentation, and model validation

Practical skills in applying CNNs and vision transformers to domain-specific challenges like geospatial land classification

The ability to communicate project outcomes effectively through model evaluation

Project scenario

You are an AI Engineer working at a fertilizer company tasked with building a land classification system for agricultural applications. Using satellite imagery, your goal is to develop models that can accurately classify different types of terrain (e.g., crops, forests, water bodies). This project will involve:

Data preprocessing: Loading and augmenting geospatial image datasets

Model development: Designing CNNs and vision transformers in Keras and PyTorch

Transfer learning: Fine-tuning pre-trained models for improved accuracy

Performance evaluation: Comparing models using metrics like accuracy, F1-score, and AU-ROC

Technical reporting: Documenting your methodology, results, and insights in a final project report

Capstone project: Phases and tasks

This project is structured into four modules, each focusing on a critical aspect of deep learning development.

Module 1: Data Handling

Objective: Learn efficient data loading and augmentation techniques for image datasets

Tasks:

Implement memory-based vs. generator-based data loading

Apply data augmentation using Keras and PyTorch

Build a custom geospatial data loader for model training

Module 2: Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) Development

Objective: Design and train CNN models for agricultural land classification

Tasks:

Develop Keras-based and PyTorch-based CNN models

Evaluate performance using accuracy, precision, and recall

Compare the strengths of each framework

Module 3:  CNN - Vision Transformer Integration

Objective: Implement vision transformers and apply transfer learning

Tasks:

Fine-tune pre-trained transformer models in Keras and PyTorch

Compare vision transformer performance against CNNs

Module 4: Final Project and Course Wrap-Up

Objective: Consolidate your work into a comprehensive solution

Tasks:

Conduct a comparative analysis of CNN and vision transformer models

Submit a final project report with performance insights

Reflect on key learnings and future applications

Final outcome

By the end of this capstone, you will have:

Built and trained CNN and vision transformer models for geospatial classification.

Applied transfer learning to enhance model performance.

Evaluated models using standard metrics (accuracy, F1-score, AU-ROC).

Produced a professional report summarizing your methodology and results.

Grading and deliverables

Your work will be assessed based on:

Functional deep learning models (CNNs and vision transformers)

Proper data handling (loading, augmentation, preprocessing)

Model evaluation (quantitative metrics and comparative analysis)

In Module 4, you will submit:

Jupyter notebooks demonstrating lab outputs and model training, evaluated for clarity, insights, and technical rigor

Note: To get the best experience, you might find it faster to download the lab notebooks and run them on your own machine. Training and testing deep learning models can require significant computing resources, and the shared online lab environment in this course has limited capacity, which may lead to slower performance.
